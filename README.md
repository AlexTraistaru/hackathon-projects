# Hackathon Projects

This repository contains projects I built during hackathons, organized by event and year.

## About

These are team-based hackathon projects covering multiple areas such as web development, machine learning, database integration, and product prototyping.

Each folder contains the code and assets for a specific hackathon submission. The goal of this repository is to keep all hackathon work in one place and provide a clear overview of the projects I contributed to.

## Hackathons Included

### 1) ZebraHack 2024
- **Folder:** `Zebrahack_2024`
- **My Contribution:** JavaScript development: Implemented JavaScript functionality for the project (frontend logic / interactive behavior).
- **Skills highlighted:** JavaScript, teamwork, rapid prototyping under time constraints

### 2) SIE (Serviciul de informatii externe) 2025
- **Folder:** `SIE-2025`

### 3) HackItAll PPC 2025
- **Folder:** `Hackitall_PPC_2025`
- **My Contribution:** Machine learning (Random Forest and Random Classifier): I implemented and tested machine learning models, including Random Forest and a random classifier baseline, for the hackathon solution.
- **Skills highlighted:** Python, machine learning, model experimentation, fast iteration

## Technologies Used (across projects)

Depending on the hackathon project, this repository includes work with:
- JavaScript
- Python
- HTML / CSS
- Java
- Databases / SQL integration

## Notes

- Some files, comments, or documentation may be in Romanian because these projects were developed in local academic / hackathon team contexts.
- This repository is organized as a collection of hackathon projects rather than a single standalone application.
