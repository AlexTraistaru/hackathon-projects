This repository contains our submission for the ZebraHack2.0 hackathon, developed under a tight deadline by team DTTA. Our project is a web platform designed to act as a "launching ramp" for students, preparing them to become future tech founders. It connects them with "Launch Romania," the largest community of tech founders in Romania. Provides students with opportunities like interactive workshops , hackathons , and events with entrepreneurs. An easy-to-use registration section (Email & WhatsApp). A contact form for universities or student organizations to request support. The site is built with a modern, intuitive, and fully responsive design, ensuring it works perfectly on all devices.
